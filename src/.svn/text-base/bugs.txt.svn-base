USER: Maxim Antipin
DATE: March 10, 2014
DESCRIPTION: Bug found in "server.c" file, related to on-disk storage. Issuing a set command would result in all entries in the table file being replaced with the new entry and it's values.
The bug was found on this line:

fprintf(fileWriteData,"%s:%s;\n",key_to_set,value_to_set);

This line is executed if the key in the table storage file does not match the key in the set command. This line should reprint a line read from the old file, but instead is printing the new
key and value. Replacing this line with:

fprintf(fileWriteData,"%s\n".bulkLoadLine1);

fixed the problem. bulkLoadLine1 is a string that was read from the old file.
